# dummydatagen
A dummy data generator.

As of now, the python script only reads a list of names and a list of surnames and makes a new file joining the names and surnames together. The "names_result.txt" file contains the end result of the mix of 12 unique first names and 88799 unique last names, giving us 1065576 different names.

The objective is that the python script receives, not only a list of names and surnames, but also different addresses, randomly generated emails based on names, date of birth or whatever and then store these results in different tables.
